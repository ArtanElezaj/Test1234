			"title": "What are the symptoms?",
			"description": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is similar to a flu. It is usually a mild or moderate disease, but some cases can become serious.The most common symptoms are: fever, cough and/or difficulty breathing. Some patients may experience tiredness, body aches, malaise in general, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or chest pain.These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people are infected, but have no symptoms or have mild, almost imperceptible symptoms. Most people(about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.About 1 in 6 people who fall ill with COVID - 19 may have the severe form of the disease. Elderly people with certain chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, have a greater risk of developing the severe form. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek immediate medical attention. A mask should be used as a way to prevent the dispersion of respiratory droplets when coughing, sneezing or talking, combined with washing or hand hygiene.After treatment, medical guidelines should be followed, avoiding frequent public or work environments, seeking to remain at home until the symptoms disappear.This will prevent the spread of viruses and the occurrence of new infections."

			"title": "How is it transmitted?",
			"description": "Expelled from the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, even when they have mild symptoms or do not feel sick. These droplets can be deposited on objects or surfaces for hours, and other people can acquire the virus by touching these contaminated objects or surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth. They can also become infected by directly breathing respiratory droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze or by direct contact such as touching or shaking hands. So it is important to stand more than 2 meters away from a sick person, and wash your hands with soap and water or alcohol gel."

This way, it is possible to prevent contaminated hands from transferring viruses to the eyes, nose or mouth, making you sick. - Make sure that you and the people around you practice good breathing etiquette.

			"title": "How is the diagnosis made?",

			"title": "Is there a vaccine, medication or treatment ? ",
			"description": "To date, there is no vaccine available against COVID - 19. There is treatment available, which prevents the disease from worsening and reduces discomfort. However, there is still no specific medication to eliminate the coronavirus. The vast majority of cases are self - limiting, that is, they are spontaneously cured.According to the World Health Organization, about 80% of cases are mild. The biggest concern is when the disease affects the elderly or people with chronic diseases(hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, etc.), in which the risk of complications increases. People with severe illness should be hospitalized. Serious cases should be referred to a Reference Hospital for isolation and treatment. Mild cases should be monitored by Primary Health Care(PHC) and home precautionary measures instituted."
